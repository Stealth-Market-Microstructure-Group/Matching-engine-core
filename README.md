# exchange-simulator
simulated exchange  built in python , handles limit /market order , fifo time priority , partial/full fills , time-zone aware ,  going to use rest api (soon) ,  agents which will place trade through api  and will have pnl tracking and much more . Made this to test my ideas for to prepare for competitions , as i felt need to have my own system..
